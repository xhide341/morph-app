# Implementation History

## Progress Bar Component Addition

- Created new ProgressBar component in `client/src/components/progress-bar.tsx`

  - Added interface `ProgressBarProps` with `currentTime` and `totalTime` props
  - Implemented `calculateProgress` function to convert time strings to percentage
  - Added smooth transition animation with `transition-all duration-1000`
  - Used Tailwind classes for styling (h-2, rounded-full, etc.)
  - Fixed progress calculation to start from left (0%) and increase to right (100%)

- Modified Clock component in `client/src/components/clock.tsx`
  - Imported ProgressBar component
  - Added ProgressBar to Clock's render method
  - Connected timer state to ProgressBar by passing:
    - `currentTime={time}`
    - `totalTime={timerMode === "work" ? lastWorkTime : lastBreakTime}`
  - Adjusted layout to accommodate progress bar with `w-full` class
  - Fixed timer logic to stop at 00:00 instead of going negative

## Redis & MongoDB Integration

### Redis Setup

- Added Redis client configuration in `server/src/config/redis.ts`
  - Configured Redis URL from environment variables
  - Added connection error handling
  - Implemented connection status logging
  - Created connectRedis utility function

### Data Storage Implementation Plan

- Decided on hybrid approach using Redis and MongoDB
  - Redis for real-time features and temporary data
  - MongoDB for persistent storage and analytics
  - Following MERN stack performance patterns
  - Implemented master data lookup pattern for frequently accessed data

### Next Steps

- Implement MongoDB connection setup
- Create data models for timer history
- Set up Redis for room activity tracking
- Add data persistence layer for completed sessions

## WebSocket Activity Tracking Flow

### Client-Side (useActivityTracker.ts)

1. Local Activity Creation

   - Generate new activity with UUID
   - Add to local state immediately
   - Send to WebSocket server

2. WebSocket Handler
   - Receive broadcast activities
   - Check for duplicates using activity.id
   - Update state if not duplicate

### Server-Side (index.ts)

1. Connection Handler

   - Parse room ID from URL
   - Send connection confirmation
   - Setup message handlers

2. Message Processing
   - Store client info on join activities
   - Save activity to Redis
   - Broadcast to all room clients

### Activity Flow

1. Client adds activity locally
2. Activity sent to WebSocket server
3. Server processes and broadcasts
4. Client receives broadcast
5. Duplicate check prevents double entries

### Next Steps

- Add activity type filtering
- Implement activity persistence
- Add error recovery for disconnections
- Add activity batching for performance

## Room Creation

1. Create room only in session page
2. redirect to room page
3. room page has username modal that will be responsible for user join activity
