# Implementation History

## Progress Bar Component Addition

- Created new ProgressBar component in `client/src/components/progress-bar.tsx`

  - Added interface `ProgressBarProps` with `currentTime` and `totalTime` props
  - Implemented `calculateProgress` function to convert time strings to percentage
  - Added smooth transition animation with `transition-all duration-1000`
  - Used Tailwind classes for styling (h-2, rounded-full, etc.)
  - Fixed progress calculation to start from left (0%) and increase to right (100%)

- Modified Clock component in `client/src/components/clock.tsx`
  - Imported ProgressBar component
  - Added ProgressBar to Clock's render method
  - Connected timer state to ProgressBar by passing:
    - `currentTime={time}`
    - `totalTime={timerMode === "work" ? lastWorkTime : lastBreakTime}`
  - Adjusted layout to accommodate progress bar with `w-full` class
